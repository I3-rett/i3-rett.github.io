This is my fifth Blender tutorial, and you can find my latest tutorial walkthrough [here](/articles/blender-airplane-loop-animation).

Last time, we created and animated a low poly airplane (and added material and lights !).
This time, we will create a simple stylized building in a street decor, following the [Cartoon Building Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvhyu9irglM&ab_channel=PolygonRunway) by Polygon Runway.

I managed to follow along nicely, and I am quite happy with the result (took me about 1 hour to complete).
